## üÜò SUPPORT

**If you need help:**
1. Review `/INSTAGRAM-STRATEGY.md` for step-by-step Instagram guide
2. Check competitor sites for logo inspiration: mobilebillboardmiami.com, therollingads.com
3. Google "How to find my Google Place ID" for review page setup

**Common Questions:**
- **"Where do I get client logos?"** - Email clients asking for their logo (most will send within 24 hours)
- **"What if I don't have 30 clients?"** - Start with 10-15, component still looks good
- **"Should I really offer $50 off?"** - YES. The Rolling Ads and Mobile Billboard Miami charge $1,500-2,500/day. Giving $50 for a review is 2-3% discount for massive social proof gain.
